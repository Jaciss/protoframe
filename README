File listing (minus stylesheet images):
/javascript/Frame.js - does most of the work
/javascript/prototype.js - the prototype javascript library (http://prototypejs.org)
/models/Frame.php - configuration, non-javascript processing
/styles/news_sheet/news_sheet.php - default stylesheet, .php to provide ease-of-use
/views/index.php	- protoframe main page, replace with your own
/views/home/index.php - 'shortcut' to the above
/views/example/index.php - example page, replace
index.php - base page, nothing much there of importance
favicon.ico - site icon, replace with icon of your choice


Setup:
Unzip protoframe somewhere in your web directory
Edit /javascript/Frame.js, line two, to reflect the name of the directory the protoframe files are in (default:protoframe)
	- Note: if the protoframe files are in the root directory this step is not necessary

Customization:
Edit /models/Frame.php to reflect your site name, slogan, etc.
Create subdirectories in /views to create new sections, placing an index.php file in each containing content
Create .php files in above subdirectories to create new pages

Optional:
Edit /styles/news_sheet/news_sheet.php - the colours, fonts, and font sizes are all defined at the top of the page.
Edit index.php - the webdev savvy can alter this and the above file to suit
You can add section-name.js files to the /javascript directory for automatic inclusion when a user visits the 'section-name' subdirectory/area of the site.  These files can define behaviours, or redefine the default behaviours, as well as containing any other javascript snippets you'd like.

Note:
If you don't want to use .php view files, replace ".php" with the extension of your choice in /javascript/Frame.js and /models/Frame.php
If you don't want to use PHP at all you'll need to do the above and rewrite models/Frame.php and index.php in the language of your choice.
